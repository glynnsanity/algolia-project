Glynn Jordan - Algolia interview homework assignment 2024

I used the [Next App Router](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch/tree/master/examples/react/next-app-router) example repo within the InstantSearch monorepo to get started using the React libraries for instantsearch functionality.

Things I added to the example as part of this project:
- Analytics tracking (Insights Middleware)
- AB testing
- SortBy component
- CSS Styling

## XML Conversion and Index Data

In the "data-manager" folder, you'll see my code for converting the given xml into JSON in the "convert.js" file, and for sending data to Algolia in the "saveData.js" file.
